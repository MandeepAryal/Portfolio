							<p>Hi there, I'm Mandeep Aryal, a rising junior in the class of 2026, studying in computer science with a data science minor. I'm not the type to remain with what I know; I love to learn new things, whether it's about technology or cuisine. I combine data analysis, artificial intelligence, and full stack development since I'm passionate about learning new things and want to provide creative solutions.</p>
							<p>I experimented with using HTML and CSS to create online applications early in my journey. I've learned a lot about advanced JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React over the years. Having worked in the field for more than two years, I enjoy working both individually and in cooperative teams. I have a strong enthusiasm for implementing technological expertise and data analysis methods. Improving the accessibility of websites and working with a variety of codebases—both current and legacy—are things I'm proud of..</p>
							<p>I'm working on a fellowship right now to broaden my knowledge of the Full Stack, and I'm using LeetCode to solve surprisingly easy tasks to hone my skills in data structures and algorithms.In addition, Codepath is where I'm doing my Technical Interview Prep course. I can quickly become proficient with new technologies and tools and make a significant contribution to projects because to my adaptability and work ethic. </p>
